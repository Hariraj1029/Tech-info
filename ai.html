      <h1 id="head">Artificial intelligence</h1>

    <p><b>Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are
    programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. The term may also be applied
    to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning and
    problem-solving.<br>
    The ideal characteristic of artificial intelligence is its ability to rationalize and take actions that
    have the best chance of achieving a specific goal. A subset of artificial intelligence is machine
    learning, which refers to the concept that computer programs can automatically learn from
    and adapt to new data without being assisted by humans. Deep learning techniques enable this
    automatic learning through the absorption of huge amounts of unstructured data such as text,
    images, or video.</b></p>
